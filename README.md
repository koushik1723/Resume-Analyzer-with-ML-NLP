# Resume-Analyzer-with-ML-NLP
A Streamlit web app that uses NLP and machine learning to classify resumes into job categories like Python Developer, Data Scientist, etc. It processes text using TF-IDF, predicts roles with a trained ML model, and allows users to upload resumes for instant predictions
# 🧠 NLP-Based Resume Classifier using Machine Learning

A smart resume screening web app that uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to predict the job category of a candidate based on the content of their resume. Built with Python and deployed using **Streamlit**, the app supports PDF or text resume uploads and outputs real-time predictions.
